# 🩺 Healthcare Assistant: AI-Powered Medical Diagnostics

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Healthcare Assistant** is a collaborative machine learning and NLP project built to simulate a virtual medical assistant. It aims to provide preliminary, symptom-based disease predictions and generate relevant follow-up questions. The project uses three separate datasets and multiple ML/DL models to evaluate and deliver the most accurate predictions.

> 🔬 **Mission**: Revolutionizing healthcare through intelligent AI-powered diagnostic assistance.
